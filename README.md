# This includes my individual Part only 
For Complete Project- https://github.com/SLIITITP/y2_s2_wd_it_01-itp_wd_bo2_g25

The project is done as per the request of the co-owner of Shantha Motors. The shop is in Mawanella 
with a manager and three other staff members who manage all the activities and transactions 
manually. 

I have developed a automated Inventory Control Management System for the Shantha Motors using MERN Stack. API Test complete with Insomnia.
The main problems identified in this section were- 

    • Not having a proper storage system for data.
    
    • Details being filled out manually and stored in files, which has caused loss of data.



Through this Section Inventory Manager able to Manage Inventory Items through these functions:
    
    ➢ Add New Inventory Item
    
    ➢ Update & Delete Inventory Item Details
    
    ➢ Display Low Stock item Details and Send Email from the Low Stock Inventory Item page
    
    ➢ Display Inventory Item Details According to the Search result

    ➢ PDF Generate for Low Stock Items & Total Stock Details
